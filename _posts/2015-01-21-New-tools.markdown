I'm trying to add some new tools to my toolbox this year. Here's
what I'm looking at:

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* [Markdown]()
* [Astropy](http://astropy.org) -- I have dabbled with some of the astropy modules, but hope to make it part of my regular workflow, and maybe even to make some [contributions]().
* [Pandas]() -- have also used this a little bit, but I think there's a lot more that can be done with it.
* [R]()
* [GIS]() -- I want to figure out how to keep better track of global and local properties of (things within) nearby galaxies. Maybe geographers have some tricks we can borrow for astronomy.
