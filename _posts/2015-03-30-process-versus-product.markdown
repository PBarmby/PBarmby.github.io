Careful readers of this blog (hi Mum!) will know that I like to knit.
Knitters often talk about whether they are ``product'' knitters, who
want the object that results from a knitting project, or ``process
knitters'' who just enjoy the activity and don't care whether they
finish things. (People who know me---again, hi Mum---will be unsurprised
to know that I'm more on the product side.)

I was thinking about whether there's an equivalent of ``process
versus product'' for research ((here)[http://smallpondscience.com/2013/05/01/what-really-is-excellence-in-teaching/].
is a nice discussion of the same in teaching). A simplistic view would be that the product of scientific research is
a publication (book, article, report, etc) and the process is all of the stuff that happens before
the publication is, well, public.  (This is related to  the idea that "doing research" and "writing it up" are
two different things, although personally I see writing as informing the research process and
not completely separate from it.) Seen this way, most people
in academia would likely say that they knew someone who was a 
"process researcher": someone who is great at designing or doing or analysing
experiments but terrible about turning them into publications. Being a
"product researcher" could also be problematic if it means that one
is tempted to cut corners on the process, since then
the product is suspect.

But I wonder: is the publication the product?
Or is "new knowledge" or "better understanding" or just "I know
a thousand things that won't work" (h/t Edison) the product? 
Is it science if you don't (or can't, because of 
(publication bias)[http://www.dovepress.com/publication-bias-what-is-it-how-do-we-measure-it-how-do-we-avoid-it-peer-reviewed-article-OAJCT])
 tell anyone what you have learned? Adam Savage says 
(you have to write it down)[http://weknowmemes.com/2012/10/the-only-difference-between-screwing-around-and-science/]
but that could argued to describe record-keeping, not publication.
I think I'm leaning towards the "new knowledge" as opposed to "publication"
description of the science product. Given that, I think most researchers must
be both process and product researchers: the process takes too long
and involves too much tedium for it to be the only joy, but the product is
so fleeting and elusive that the process must be at least somewhat fun. 
What do you think?
