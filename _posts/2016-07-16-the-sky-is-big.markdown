Apparently I have too much spare time, because I'm spending some of it knitting
[Celestarium](http://www.twistcollective.com/collection/component/content/article/104-winter-2012-patterns/1294-celestarium-by-audry-nicklin),
a shawl that maps out the northern constellations. I had an interesting professional realization while working
on it over the weekend: the sky is *big*. I mean, *really big*.

I calculated that Celestarium has about 50120 stitches, not counting the edging. It's supposed to be half the celestial sphere, so that's 2pi
[steradians](http://www.physlink.com/education/askexperts/ae174.cfm) or 20626.5 square degrees<sup>1</sup>. 
This means that each stitch is about 0.4 square degrees, or roughly one and a half times the area that the full Moon covers on the sky.

In my professional work I've worked on astronomical images covering what I would have said were pretty big pieces of sky, like
this one from a [recent paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06903):

This image of region of sky containing the Andromeda galaxy is about 6.6 degrees along the upper-left-to-lower-right diagonal
(the major axis of the galaxy) and about 4.4 degrees the other way. There are an awful lot of stars in that image here's a close-up
of part of it:

This image covers about 0.2 square degrees - half a stitch in my knitted piece, with millions of M31 stars and billions more in the background (look for the the distant galaxies on the right-hand side). "Deep field" observations like the [Hubble Extreme Deep Field](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/xdf.html) cover even smaller areas than this.

Physically knitting these many many stitches, and realizing that each of them represented an area quite large compared to the nearby galaxies that I think about every day, really brought home to me how big the sky is. Surveying all of it, or even some reasonable fraction, is a pretty heroic endeavour. It's no accident that the 
[Sloan Digital Sky Survey](http://www.sdss.org) and the [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope](http://www.lsst.org), to name just a couple of surveys,
needed huge teams of people to make them work.

It's a big universe. Seems fitting that the sky should be big too.
