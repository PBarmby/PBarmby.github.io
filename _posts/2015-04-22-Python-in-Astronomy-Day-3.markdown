The day started with contributed talks by Adam Ginsberg ([astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)), Victor Terron ([LEMON](http://lemon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)), and Arjen van Elteren [AMUSE](http://amusecode.org/)). These three different packages do quite different things: query remote archives, automate differential photometry, and glue different pieces of astronomy software together. During the last talk there was an interesting [Twitter discussion](https://twitter.com/Iguananaut/status/590796321847672832) of why astronomers call their packages-of-software "codes".

After coffee: [Britton Smith](http://www.roe.ac.uk/ifa/people/brs.html) of Edinburgh gave an overview of the [yt](http://yt-project.org) project. As it says on the webpage, "[the] yt project aims to produce an integrated science environment for collaboratively asking and answering astrophysical questions."

Finally the conference dinner, which was great fun and featured ice cream with sparklers in it for dessert. As far as I know, no
one's hair was lit on fire.
