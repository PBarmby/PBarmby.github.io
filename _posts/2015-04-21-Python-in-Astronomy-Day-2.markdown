The day started with contributed talks by Althea Morehead (Python for [meteors](http://www.nasa.gov/offices/meo/home/)), Edward Gomez (Python in a [global telescope network](http://lcogt.net/),
Vanessa Moss ([arxiver](https://arxiver.wordpress.com/); Vanessa also produced an interesting [map](http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~vmoss/jobvis/index_pia.html) of where the participants came from. I think I can claim most-national-land-area-per-person title.)


After coffee: [Eric Tollerud](http://www.astro.yale.edu/etollerud/) gave an overview of the [astropy](http://astropy.org) project.
He took us through some of the history and raised a number of interesting points. Storify [here](https://storify.com/PBarmby/astropy-talk-by-e-tollerud).
