OK, I know these blog posts are getting more terse. What can I say, it's been a busy week and I at least am getting tired. 
On the other hand, [Antonio MArtin Carrillo](LINK) is gaining steam! Check out his detailed blog posts.
Despite last night being the conference dinner, nearly everyone made it to the first talk this morning. Although we were a bit quiet..

The day started with contributed talks by Steve Crawford ([ccdproc](http://ccdproc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)), Anne Archibald ([testing statistical tests](http://lighthouseinthesky.blogspot.nl/)), and Nadia Dencheva ([generalized world coordinate systems](http://gwcs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)).

After morning coffee: [Stuart Mumford](http://www.stuartmumford.co.uk/) of Sheffield gave an overview of the [sunpy](http://sunpy.org) project. Storify [here](https://storify.com/PBarmby/python-in-astronomy-day-4-keynote).

Finally lightning talks, Storified [here](https://storify.com/PBarmby/python-in-astronomy-day-4-lightning-talks).

The afternoon unconference sessions featured less tweeting and note-taking as we were busy working on lots of
different things, such as:

Sessions one/two:

* Python packaging and releasing, E. Bray [LINK]()
* astropy modeling, E. Tollerud [LINK]()
* astro-computing education (new wiki page [here](http://www.astrobetter.com/wiki/astro-comp-ed))
* ginga collaboration sprint, E. Jeschke 

Session three:

* intermediate git topics, E. Bray E. Bray [LINK]()
* Python and galaxies, S. Crawford (notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lU6Qxd8AXYQaYTuejPyCfDJRPCTV6xB0X-C6nVBu_sY/edit))
* SunPy/wcs hack, S. Mumford
* Toyz demo, F. Moolecamp

We ended off with some summaries and a quick poll: one of the people who's been following along on Twitter asked me to find out what fraction of attendees used Python 2 vs Python 3. The answer: about 90% Python 2 and 10% Python 3, but that 10% (5 people) includes some of our most active developers. I guess the rest of us should get our acts together and just switch.
