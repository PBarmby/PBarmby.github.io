Astronomers who are not devotees of the fibre arts or might be surprised to learn that there are many, many 
yarns named after things astronomical. Why, you say?

There are a huge number of craftspeople who produce hand-dyed yarns for knitters, crocheters,
and weavers, including my town's own [Sheepspot](http://www.sheepspot.com) among others. These
folks need to distinguish their different **colourways** (the result of all of the dyes
applied to one particular yarn, could include many colours) and **bases** (the type of yarn being
dyed, distinguished for example by thickness and type of fiber such as wool, silk, or cotton).
Some colourways have names which just describe the colours, but many others are inspired by
something else: superheroes, birds, Doctor Who characters, [Sherlock or Firefly quotes](http://www.indigodragonfly.ca/colours/), you name it.

Hence, astronomy-themed yarns. Here is a round-up of a few different places to find them;
this is by no means exhaustive!

* [Luna Grey Fiber Arts](http://www.lunagreyfiberarts.com/) has bases like
[starbright](http://www.lunagreyfiberarts.com/search?type=product&q=starbright),
[Lyra](http://www.lunagreyfiberarts.com/search?type=product&q=lyra), 
[Orion](http://www.lunagreyfiberarts.com/search?type=product&q=orion), 
and [Supernova](http://www.lunagreyfiberarts.com/search?type=product&q=supernova).
They also sell a kit for the [White Dwarf shawl](http://www.lunagreyfiberarts.com/products/white-dwarf-shawl-kit-pattern-yarn).

* [Barking Dog Yarns](http://barkingdogyarns.com/) has bases
[Galaxy](https://barkingdogyarns.danemcoweb.com/shop/category/yarn-bases/galaxy-2/),
[Sirius](https://barkingdogyarns.danemcoweb.com/shop/category/yarn-bases/sirius-1/),
[Antares](https://barkingdogyarns.danemcoweb.com/shop/category/yarn-bases/antares/) and
[Cassiopeia](https://barkingdogyarns.danemcoweb.com/shop/category/yarn-bases/cassiopeia/)
(no, I can't spell that one correctly the first time either).

* [Cosmic Fibers Yarn](https://www.etsy.com/shop/cosmicfibersyarn) also goes with the
constellation theme for bases, including some of the more, shall we say, obscure
constellations like Ara and Pyxis. 

* [String Theory Colorworks](http://shop.selfstriping.com/) specializes in self-striping yarns
whose colourways are named after elements, physics concepts, and astronomical objects, including 
[Omega Centauri](http://shop.selfstriping.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=35_48_49_102),
[Trifid Nebula](http://shop.selfstriping.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=35_48_49_139),
[Triangulum Galaxy](http://shop.selfstriping.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=35_48_50_78) and
[Binary System](http://shop.selfstriping.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=35_48_56_208).
([My binary system socks](http://ravel.me/Andromeda31/3zq8i) were made at [CASCA 2013](casca2013.phas.ubc.ca), in case you were wondering.)


* [Solstice Yarns](https://www.etsy.com/shop/solsticeyarns) seems to have had a number
of astro-themed yarns in the past, including a beautiful [Andromeda](http://images4-b.ravelrycache.com/uploads/SolsticeYarns/67944674/il_570xn.255374420_small2.jpg) but none listed currently.

* [Alcidina](https://www.etsy.com/shop/alcidina) has some beautiful colourways inspired by
[Hubble Space Telescope](http://www.stsci.edu/hst) images but seems to be on temporary hiatus.
It's worth checking back later for these.

The list so far has focused on independent dyers with a heavy astronomy focus, but there are many 
larger yarn companies with some astro-themed yarns like [Berroco's Quasar](http://www.berroco.com/yarns/berroco-quasar)
and [Prism's Galaxy](http://www.prismyarn.com/galaxy.htm) plus plenty of one-off colourways 
like [Blue Moon's Stardust](http://www.bluemoonfiberarts.com/newmoon/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=19_20_1088).
As most yarn fanatics know, [Ravelry](http://ravelry.com)'s databse is your friend, although
as far as I know you can only search it by yarn name and not colourway name.

What are your favorites? Send them to me and I'll start a list!
