The blog has been quiet lately, and I have to write a report on how I spent my sabbatical. So...

I've already covered [January]({% post_url 2015-02-03-January-wrapup %}), [February]({% post_url 2015-03-03-February-wrapup %})
and [March]({% post_url 2015-04-04-March-wrapup %}) here, so I don't have to go that far back. 
But April seems like a long time ago. It is interesting to try and look back 5-7 months and figure out what I was
doing. Blogging turns out to have been useful for this but so were my electronic calendar, sent mail, and
even my GitHub [contributions](https://github.com/PBarmby?tab=contributions), which I realize are
looking quite pathetic lately.

What did I do in April? Well, I blogged a lot. I went to 
[Python in Astronomy 2015](http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2015/683/info.php3?wsid=683), part
of the reason for the lots-of-blogging. Since I was on the organzing committee there was some last-minute
running about before the meeting, and also some work afterwards 
(like the [talk slide](https://github.com/python-in-astronomy/talk_slides) and 
[useful link](https://github.com/python-in-astronomy/PythonAstronomy_links) repositories).
But I also spent a lot of April finishing a Letter of Intent for a proposal to 
[NSERC CREATE](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Professors-Professeurs/Grants-Subs/CREATE-FONCER_eng.asp).

How about May? I ran a [Software Carpentry workshop]({% post_url 2015-05-13-software-carpentry-western %}),
organized the [87th meeting of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
Scientific Advisory Council](http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/SAC/reports/SAC_report_May15.php),
went to part of the [CASCA](http://casca.ca) Board of Directors meeting, and [walked 70 km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicklow_Way) 
on vacation. (I might leave that part out of my official report.)

June involved some [more vacation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douro), the [Future and Science of Gemini](http://www.gemini.edu/fsg15)
meeting and associated [user's committee meeting]({% post_url 2015-06-21-Users-Committee-for-Gemini %}) meeting, a bunch of 
getting-ready-to-be-an-administrator meetings, another Software Carpentry [workshop]({% post_url  2015-06-28-wise-software-carpentry %}) and quite a bit of meeting with my grad students as I prepared to work elsewhere for a big chunk of July.
Sometime in June I learned that my CREATE letter of intent didn't make the cut for submission of a full proposal. Bah.

During all of this time I was working on various papers with grad students, as discussed 
[here]({% post_url 2015-07-16-All-M31-all-the-time %}); of these I am pleased to say that 

* paper #1 hasn't gone anywhere (ok not so pleased about that)
* paper #2 is [published](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05781) 
* paper #3 is submitted, got a referee's report, and is nearly finished revisions 
* paper #4 will be submitted in the next few weeks
* paper #5 was submitted last week

All in all not a bad 6 months. What do you think, should I just submit this blog post as my report, hyperlinks and all?
