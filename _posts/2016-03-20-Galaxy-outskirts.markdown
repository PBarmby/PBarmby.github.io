I'm on the way home from the [Formation and Evolution of Galaxy Outskirts](http://galaxyoutskirts.org)
conference, an [International Astronomical Union](http://iau.org) Symposium held in Toledo,
Spain from March 14-18, 2016. 

Tweets from the conference are [here](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23iaus321) and the program is 
[here](http://galaxyoutskirts.org/index.php/scientific-program/), so I won't attempt to mention nearly every talk the way I did last year with
[Python in Astronomy]({% post_url 2015-04-30-Python-in-Astronomy-review %}). I think the 
organizers did a good job with scheduling the program, moving from talks
about observations of the Milky Way and nearest galaxies to computational simulations of galaxy formation, 
observations of more distant galaxies, and finally the gas around very distant galaxies. The daily
schedule seemed more punishing than typical conferences, but I think that was probably due to
a combination of jet lag and Spanish mealtimes rather than an unreasonable number of talks.

What did I get out of the meeting? I found the talks about simulations
particularly interesting; this is an area I haven't had a lot of exposure to in recent years
so it's good to see the state of the art. I was impressed by instrumentation
advances such as [Dragonfly](http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/instrumentation/dragonfly/) and 
[MUSE](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/muse.html) and 
[KMOS](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/kmos.html) on the 
[VLT](http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal/). The outskirts of
galaxies are faint and difficult to study; these instruments represent
very sophisticated and clever approaches to dealing with this problem
Exciting discoveries are going to be made with them in the next few years.

Speaking of the next few years, the [JWST](http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/) launch is about two and a half years away.
The last session of the conference brought home the fact that it's time to start thinking *now* about writing
proposals for this telescope -- it has a limited lifetime and so it's important to maximize
the use we get out of it. Some of the science program will be decided before launch, in the
[next 18 months](http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/operations/proposals) or thereabouts, so it really is time to get going.

Here are science take-aways from the meeting. None of these are particularly brilliant
insights, rather they are just themes that seemed to keep recurring.

* there's good evidence that galaxies form inside-out, so the outskirts are younger than the centre 
* very distant (and therefore very young) galaxies often have a lot of structure, which must therefore have formed very early 
* the physical conditions in the outskirts of galaxies are different from those in more-populated parts,
and not necessarily well-modelled (yet)
* a galaxy's interactions with its environment mostly take place in its outskirts

I was happy to see a lot of instances of "open science" popping up in the meeting, from the
publically-available [RAMSES](https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses) code, to the 
[Stripe 82 Legacy Project](http://www.iac.es/proyecto/stripe82/) and [DAGAL databases](http://www.dagalnetwork.eu/public-scientific-deliverables).
As I have said [before]({% post_url 2016-01-27-Data-sharing-in-astronomy %}), I think people who
work on nearby galaxies are pretty good about sharing data, and the [Illustris]() simulation
group seems to be as well. I had an interesting chat with B. Madore about the future
of [NED](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu) --- it will be interesting to see where that particular
avenue for data sharing goes.

All in all, a good conference -- I met some new folks and renewed some old acquaintances, thought a lot
about galaxies, and ate a lot of Spanish ham. Not a bad way to spend a week.
