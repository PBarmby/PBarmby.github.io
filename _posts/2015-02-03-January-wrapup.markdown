So, the first month of sabbatical is gone! What did I do with my time?

* Attended the [225th AAS meeting](http://aas.org/meetings/aas225). That was
pretty fun; I haven't been to a winter AAS meeting since I started working
at Western so I got to see a lot of old friends. I helped with a [Software Carpentry workshop](http://abostroem.github.io/2015-01-03-aas/)
and Tweeted [a lot](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AAS225%20from%3APBarmby).

* Moved to my new sabbatical office in Western's [Computer Science Department](http://www.csd.uwo.ca).
Besides being less-findable by the usual suspects, I hope this will allow me to start some
new collaborations. So far I have mostly been keeping quiet and not knocking on doors, but this
will change soon.

* Dealt with a few remaining issues from last term's teaching: this usually happens in the
fall term as people who miss the final exam (e.g. due to illness) are usually not better before
the end of the exam period!

* Caught up with my colleagues at the 
[Faculty of Science's Pedagogical Reading Group](http://www.uwo.ca/sci/about_science/teaching_and_learning/reading_group.html). 
Yes, I'm on sabbatical and supposed to be focused on research, but some reflection on teaching is a nice change of pace.

* Attended an "Introduction to Geographic Information Systems" [workshop](http://www.lib.uwo.ca/news/wl/2015/01/23/geographicinformationsystemsgisworkshops.html)
(see [this post](/2015/01/28/AGIS.html)) and started to look into wther adapting GIS tools
for astronomy is worth the effort.

* Came up with an idea for a grant proposal under the [NSERC CREATE](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Professors-Professeurs/Grants-Subs/CREATE-FONCER_eng.asp) 
program. Not feeling quite Open-Science enough to discuss it in detail before submission though.

* Decided not to write a Gemini Large Program proposal; couldn't think of the killer idea in time to submit the
Letter of Intent (due yesterday).

* Did quite a bit of stuff on [GitHub](https://github.com/PBarmby): check out that contributions graph! Actually it
is pretty funny to see how my contribution activity anti-correlates with busy teaching times.

* Organized a location for the next meeting of the [CFHT Scientific Advisory Council](http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/en/science/SAC/): it's
going to be at the [David Dunlap Observatory](http://www.theddo.ca) which should be fun.

Unfortunately "submitted paper" is not anywhere in that list. Will keep trying.
