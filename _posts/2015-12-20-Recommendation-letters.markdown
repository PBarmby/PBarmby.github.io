'Tis the season, both for holiday stuff and for reference/recommendation letters. Such letters are
one of the unusual features of academia, not always easy to explain to people outside.
(For students: I'm sorry to say that asking people to write letters for you doesn't stop when you
graduate or even when you get a tenure-track job. There are still letters to be written for 
tenure and/or promotion, awards, and even certain grants.)

Lots has been written about them, including:

* [How to ask for a letter of recommendation](http://www.universityaffairs.ca/career-advice/career-advice-article/how-to-ask-for-a-reference-letter/)
* [How to write a letter of recommendation](http://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2010/12/21/recommendation-letter-writing-round-up/)
* [Checking for bias in your letter of recommendation](http://www.tomforth.co.uk/genderbias/)

I'm writing letters for several different people this season, and have done sufficiently many to date that
I decided to write a [script](https://github.com/PBarmby/rec-letters) to make sure that I send the
right letter to the right place.
It's not uncommon for someone graduating with a PhD in astronomy to apply for 20 different positions,
or someone applying to graduate programs to apply for the same number. While there are services like
[Academic Jobs Online](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo) and [Interfolio](http://www.interfolio.com/) that help with the distribution of reference letters, there's
still a lot of time involved in requesting, writing, collecting, and reading them.

So why do we bother? What's so special about academia that we need this time-consuming procedure that
nobody else does? Presumably we think there is some information contained in letters that's not transmitted
in the transcripts, CVs, cover letters, research and/or teaching statements that a candidate submits.
My experience with being on search and admissions committees is that at least some faculty use 
letters as a major screening tool; a good set of letters is a necessity to get to the next round.

One assumption about recommendation letters would be that they give some kind of neutral, independent assessment of the person and/or their work. 
But I don't think it's that simple. Many of these kinds of letters also reflect on the letter-writer:
saying that someone who worked with me as a grad student is terrible reflects badly on me, since it implies that
either I didn't train them well or I was foolish to take them on in the first place. As supervisors
we generally want to see our students succeed and so we write letters that emphasize their positive qualities.
If anyone doubts that this is necessary, I can't count the number of grad-school application forms that
I've filled out recently that ask if a student is in the top 5, 10 or 25% of some cohort - it's clear that anybody below
that limit is disfavoured. At least in North America, a mostly-if-not-completely-positive letter is
almost a requirement.

So if a recommendation letter is not an entirely neutral assessment, what else is it for? Sometimes
letters are used to explain complex situations that may not be clear from a CV. Suppose a student changed
programs or supervisors because of something out of the student's control; a third-party explanation of
the situation (and the fact that it wasn't the student's fault) could be very helpful. Sometimes letters
are used to explain particular hardships or challenges that a candidate has overcome. It can be
difficult for someone to write about such situations themselves without sounding either whiny or
self-serving, whereas a letter from someone else can put the situation in context.

Emphasizing the positive and explaining the negative both seem like worthy goals, but I'm still not 
completely unconvinced that this makes recommendation letters worth the effort involved. It seems like
there should be better ways to get information to the people who need it. Is the big difference between academia and
industry the fact that it's hard to fire people in academia, so we feel like we need
additional security in finding the "right" person? Or is it that the competition for positions is so much more
intense? I still don't know, but will continue to think about this as I keep sending in my letters..
