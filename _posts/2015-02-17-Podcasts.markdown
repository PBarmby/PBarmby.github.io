I hear that [Serial](http://serialpodcast.org) got a lot of people interested in podcasts.
I've been a podcast listener for a long time, probably close to a decade now. In the
[Physics & Astronomy blog](http://blog.physics.uwo.ca) several years back I listed some of my favorite
[science podcasts](http://blog.physics.uwo.ca/science-podcasts/) and
[physics or astronomy](http://blog.physics.uwo.ca/physics-astronomy-podcasts/) ones;
I still listen to many of these.

The science podcasts listed above can mostly be categorized as "science journalism" --
that is, they involve research or other science happenings being explained to
non-scientists. But what about podcasts for scientists, by scientists? Podcasts
where people talk about what they're working on, the tips they have for others
so they don't make the same mistakes? Maybe I listen to too many knitting podcasts
where this style is pretty common, but I haven't yet found it in the science podcast world.
The closest so far:

* [Scientists not the Science](http://www.stuartgregoryhiggins.com/scinotsci), a "podcast about people working in and with the scientific world"
* [People Behind the Science](http://www.peoplebehindthescience.com/), a "journey through the lives and minds of today's brilliant scientists"
* [Story Collider](http://storycollider.org/podcast), personal stories about science


Podcasts about university-level teaching, especially teaching science, are rare too. I've found:

* [Teaching and Learning Matters](http://teaching.uncc.edu/learning-resources/podcasts) - produced by a university
teaching & learning center, not science-specific
* [Teaching in Higher Ed](http://teachinginhighered.com/episodes/) - no catch phrase but looks interesting, , not science-specific
* [Lab out Loud](http://laboutloud.com/) - "science for the classroom and beyond"
* [Learning about Teaching Physics](http://learningaboutteachingphysics.podomatic.com/) -- no new episodes,
but the old ones were good..

Comments on other podcasts are welcome, just as soon as I figure out how to turn comments on..
please tweet at me in the meantime!
