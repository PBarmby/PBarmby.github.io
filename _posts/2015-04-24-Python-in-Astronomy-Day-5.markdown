The day started with contributed talks by Emilie Ishida ([COIN](LINK)), Matt Craig ([astropy with undergrads](LINK)), and X ([coordinat]()).

After coffee: [Perry Greenfield]() of STScI gave an overview of the history of Python at the Space Telescopes Science Institute.  Storify [here](https://storify.com/PBarmby/python-in-astronomy-day-5-keynote).

Finally lightning talks, Storified [here](https://storify.com/PBarmby/python-in-astronomy-day-5-lightning-talks).

We finished with a general discussion of preserve the week's work and move forward. Ideas for preserving the week's work include
having a [repository of talk slides](https://github.com/python-in-astronomy/talk_slides) and a [list of packages discussed](https://github.com/python-in-astronomy/repo_list/blob/master/link_list.md) as well as an "unproceedings" document [link](ADD LINK).
To keep momentum going, we have started a number of mailing lists (LINKS HERE); we also talked about starting local user groups, having regional conferences, and organizing a future meeting at a location TBD. Ideas for how to improve the next version of the meeting included:

* pre-conference tutorial days, or post-conference work/hack days
* additional time during which unconferences are not scheduled
* some scheduling of unconferences or tutorials in advance
* a shorter lunch period for more work time

After this we did the conference picture. [LINK]

The afternoon unconference sessions included:

* next steps for astropy [LINK]
