This is Pauline Barmby's blog, containing musings about astrophysics, science teaching, computing, and science fiction, with occasional knitting and curling. Made using Jekyll and published on [github.com](https://github.com/) in a technology that may or may not still work.

If you have found this blog and are interested in my fiction, find my isfdb page [here](https://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?341924). More intersted in my academic non-fiction? That's [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=%20author%3A%22Barmby%2C%20P%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0).
