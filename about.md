This is Pauline Barmby's blog, containing musings about astrophysics, science teaching, computing, and perhaps knitting, curling, and science fiction. Made using Jekyll and published on [github.com](https://github.com/) just to be geeky.

Some earlier blog posts can be found on [my department's blog](http://blog.physics.uwo.ca/); check [here](http://blog.physics.uwo.ca/author/pauline-barmby/).
