The (astro)physics world, if no one else, was abuzz recently with the news of LIGO's [first detection of gravitational waves](). 
I was a prospective graduate student 20 years ago, and I remember very clearly standing in the office of a professor
while he explained to me what LIGO was supposed to do. In my hubris at the time, I thought the whole thing sounded insane -- 
detecting what ridiculously tiny motion? Which may or may not even exist?
That, plus the fact that the grad students who I met in his department seemed to me to be very unhappy, 
meant that I ended up going in a different direction. My career to date has had lots of highlights,
but LIGO being in the news did make me wonder what might have been. Would I have been
able to stick it out, working in a field where there were no results for 20 years? Would I have
been happier working as part of a gigantic collaborative team? 

It is graduate school admissions season, so I have looked at quite a few applications. Most of them are from
people who are currently undergraduate students. I wonder if some of these folks are
doing what a colleague once described as "hitting the snooze button on the alarm clock of life"---
applying to graduate progams because they have always been in school and are not sure what else to do.
In my humble opinion, *this is not a good reason to go to graduate school*. While there are certainly
[structural problems in science graduate education]() that need improving, I think science graduate
programs are likely to continue to require some kind of personal compromise: of lost income, personal
mobility, or ...

For some people, then, the whole process of graduate education should be a "road not taken". The 
compromises may not be worth it. Another way to think about it is that grad school should be a road not taken
*yet*. In most cases there is little to be lost by taking some time away between an undergraduate and
graduate degrees. It's true that  some of your technical skills might get a bit rusty if you don't use them,
and the logistics of applying to grad school can be more straightforward when you are located at your
undergrad institution.  The big gain, however, is in the time that you get to reflect and to think about 
what you really want to do. What did you enjoy about your undergraduate studies? Waht are you hoping to
get out of graduate school? The two experiences are very different,
