If you asked a non-academic which part of an academic's job was
more public, research or teaching, I think most people would say
teaching. After all, teaching is done with other people, while
research is performed by a lonely person in a lab, right? 
OK, we all know that the latter isn't really the case---research
in most science fields is done with with students and colleagues---
but is it still more private than teaching? I would argue that in fact,
*teaching* is more private. The `Open Science' movement is starting
to make the idea of doing research in a public way more popular, but I
don't think we yet have the equivalent in teaching.

Say I consider the academic colleagues in my department, the 
ones I don't do research with, like the theoretical condensed matter
physicists. Unless I am co-teaching a course with them, or they ask me directly, 
it's not that easy for these colleagues to find out
the details of my teaching. If they want to know what research I have done
recently, they can read my papers or conference abstracts,
attend my grad students' talks, or look up my [CV](https://github.com/PBarmby/cv).
Our [department's website](http://www.physics.uwo.ca) tells them what courses I am teaching, and
if they are desperate for entertainment, my colleagues could even
read my course outlines, linked from there. (They would quickly find that at least
half of the course outlines consist of the same required legalese
that is in their own outlines.) However, the details of what I do in class
and what I ask the students to do outside of class are not easy to find.
Much of this information is on our learning management system, but
we don't automatically have access to sites for courses where we're not the instructor.
My colleagues from other institutions would have even less access.

The bad thing about "private" teaching is that a lot of effort is wasted
but not having easy access to others' teaching material. If I am teaching
a third-year course, and I have to jump through a lot of hoops to find out
what approach was taken by the instructor of the pre-requisite second-year course,
I'm probably not going to bother, to the detriment of the students. (Couldn't
I just walk down the hall to the office of the person who taught the second-year course?
Not if that person was a contract instructor who is no longer around.)
If I am teaching an "Astronomy 101" course and can't find appropriate material available,
I going to either develop my own material, thus reinventing the wheel, or rely heavily on publisher-provided
material (free to instructors but contributes to increasing costs for students).

Greg Wilson of [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) has mused about this issue before, and
advocated the idea of `open source teaching'. Software Carpentry certainly tries to 
do this with its curriculum. In higher education in general, we see some of this
kind of teaching in places like EdX and Coursera. But EdX, Coursera, and even Software
Carpentry are `not for credit' kinds of teaching. Is the bargain we make, then? Pay us money,
and we will give you official credit and access to our secret material, or take
our courses for free but don't expect an official credential. I wonder if there isn't
some middle ground which enables more teaching best practices to be shared.
