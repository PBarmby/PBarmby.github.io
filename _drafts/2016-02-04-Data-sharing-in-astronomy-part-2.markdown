At the end of the [previous post]({% post_url 2016-01-27-Data-sharing-in-astronomy %}), I mentioned that
there is a lot of freely-available astronomy data, but finding it can be a problem. The proposed 
solution to this is an idea called the Virtual Observatory, "the vision that astronomical
datasets and other resources should work as a seamless whole."  So what exactly *is* this Virtual Observatory --
is it a website you can use to download all the data from every telescope ever, on whatever piece of
the sky you care about? Not so much. In fact there is not one virtual observatory but a 
[whole bunch of them](http://www.ivoa.net/about/member-organizations.html) including
[EuroVO](http://www.euro-vo.org/), [(US)VAO](http://www.usvao.org), [VO-India](http://vo.iucaa.ernet.in/~voi/)
and many more. 

The [International Virtual Observatory Alliance](http://www.ivoa.net/), which has been around for
over 10 years, coordinates the efforts of all of the individual VOs. They have meetings to coordinate on 
standards -- what format should we use for tabular data? How should we query astronomical databases? How
should metadata be dsecribed?
