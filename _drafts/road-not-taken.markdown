The (astro)physics world, if no one else, was abuzz recently with the news of LIGO's [first detection of gravitational waves](). 
I was a prospective graduate student 20 years ago, and I remember very clearly standing in the office of one of the LIGO PIs
while he explained to me what LIGO was supposed to do. In my hubris at the time, I thought the whole thing sounded insane -- 
detecting what kinds of motion? How? That, plus the fact that the grad students in that department seemed to me to be very unhappy, 
meant that I ended up going in a different direction.

My own graduate experience was mostly pretty good.
