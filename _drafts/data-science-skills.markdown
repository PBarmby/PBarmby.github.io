I am taking a second swing at the CREATE grant I submitted last year. As part of the research for this thing, I have 
spent quite a bit of time talking to people who work in data science (mostly former astronomers), 
looking at job ads for "data scientists", reading blog posts and articles, and so
forth. The goal was to figure out what can be added to astronomy graduate students' training to make them more
accomplished users of data in astronomy, and more hireable outside of astronomy should they choose to go that route. 
I don't have huge samples of either job ads or interviewees but there are enough similarities in what I hear from the
different directions that I'm reasonably confident in the results.

Looking at the job ads, the specified background varies. Some specify a background in computer sccience or statistics, others
expand this to include mathematics or applied math, or further to engineering or a physical science, one just specified "STEM".
Degrees in machine learning were specified in several ads, which is interesting since there aren't that many such programs
The University of Alberta [has a graduate program](https://uofa.ualberta.ca/computing-science/graduate-studies/programs-and-admissions/statistical-machine-learning)
and University of Toronto at Scarborough 
[an undergrad one](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/admissions/programs/statistics-machine-learning-data-mining-stream-quantitative-finance-stream)
but I couldn't find any others with machine leraning in the title.

The number one skill, specified in every job ad, was "excellent communications skills." An example of this that I thought was
particularly clear, and something that echoed what I heard from interviewing people in industry, was \
"ability to communicate complex quantitative analysis in a clear, precise, and actionable manner." Technical skills that appeared in
most of the ads included SQL, Python, and statistics or machine learning. Many of the ads included mention of R, HDFS/Hadoop,
and Spark. Mentioned less frequently were data visualization, MATLAB, Excel, and cloud computing. 

The people I interviewed also mentioned Python, SQL, and statistics/machine learning frequently. Several also mentioned
a technical skill that didn't come up in the job ads- software-engineering-type skills, like the ability to work in
teams on a computational project, using version control (especially git and GitHub), and writing re-usable code.
At least one interviewee told me that people in industry write lousy code "just like in academia", so this wasn't universal.
What did seem pretty universal was the idea that astronomers in particular need to get more used to the idea of
applying existing tools rather than writing their own; our tradition of re-inventing the wheel for our own private use
is no longer sustainable.

What do physicists or astronomers bring to data science? Solving large, open-ended problems using quantitative methods
is probably the most important thing, although in industrial data science the timescales are usually faster, and
the solutions don't have to be as perfect (but they do have to be actionable). Experience of working with large amounts 
of real data, some of which may be noisy or unusable, is also important.
