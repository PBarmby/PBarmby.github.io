Careful readers of this blog (hi Mum!) will know that I like to knit.
Knitters often talk about whether they are ``product'' knitters, who
want the object that results from a knitting project, or ``process
knitters'' who just enjoy the activity and don't care whether they
finish things. (People who know me---again, hi Mum---will be unsurprised
to know that I'm more on the product side.)

I was thinking about whether there's an equivalent of ``process
versus product'' for research. A simplistic view would be that the product is
a publication and the process is all of the stuff that happens before
the publication is, well, public.  (This is related to  the idea that "doing research" and "writing it up" are
two different things, although personally I see writing as informing the research process and
not completely separate from it.) Seen this way, most people
in academia would likely say that they knew someone who was a 
"process researcher": someone who is great at designing or doing or analysing
experiments but terrible about turning them into publications.

But I wonder: is the publication the product?
Or is "new knowledge" or "better understanding" or just "I know
a thousand things that won't work" (h/t Edison) the product? Is it science
if you don't tell anyone? Adam Savage says 
(you have to write it down)[http://weknowmemes.com/2012/10/the-only-difference-between-screwing-around-and-science/]
but that could be record-keeping, not publication.
