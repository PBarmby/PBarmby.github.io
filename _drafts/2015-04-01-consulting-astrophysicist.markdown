A couple of weeks ago, I got a phone call asking whether I'd be interested
in consulting for a video game company. They were developing a game set in
space, targeted at kids in my son's age group, and wanted an astrophysicist 
who could answer some questions. The work would involve some meetings at 
their offices plus some remote work on my part reviewing materials --
a few days' total. It sounded interesting, so I agreed, signed a many-page
form, and made plans to go and see them.

The first meeting I had at the company involved half a dozen team members
and lasted about 6 hours. They spent several hours giving me an overview of 
the game, which if I understand correctly is roughly half-way through a 
multi-year development process. It seemed like a pretty neat concept.
I confess that I never thought that all of the conversations I've had
with our son about video games would have been so useful, but they really did 
make it easier for me to follow the game ideas.


We had lunch, at which I probably talked
too much, then in the afternoon they asked me lots of questions. The team
members had done quite a bit of relevant research but needed more detail
than websearching alone could supply. I think I was able to answer most
of their questions -- which spanned quite a few of the different topics
that I've taught in introductory astronomy -- in a reasonable way. We
had quite a bit of fun discussing ideas and I found it a very interesting day.
