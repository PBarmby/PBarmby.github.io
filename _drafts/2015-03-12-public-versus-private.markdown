If you asked a non-academic which part of an academic's job was
more public, research or teaching, I think most people would say
teaching. After all, teaching is done with other people, while
research is performed by a lonely person in a lab, right? 
OK, we all know that the latter isn't really the case---research
in most science fields is done with with students and colleagues---
but is it still more private than teaching? I would argue that in fact,
*teaching* is more private. The `Open Science' movement is starting
to make the idea of doing research in public more popular, but I
don't think we yet have the equivalent in teaching.

Say I consider the academic colleagues in my department, the 
ones I don't do research with, like the theoretical condensed matter
physicists. Unless I am co-teaching a course with them, or they ask me directly, 
it's not that easy for these colleagues to find out
the details of my teaching. If they want to know what research I have done
recently, they can read my papers or conference abstracts,
attend my grad students' talks, or look up my [CV]().
Our department's website tells them what courses I am teaching, and
if they are desperate for entertainment, my colleagues could even
read my course outlines. (They would quickly find that at least
half of the course outlines consist of the same required legalese
that is in their own outlines.) However, the details of what I do in class
and what I ask the students to do outside of class are not easy to find.
Much of this information is on [OWL]() our learning management system, but
we don't automatically have access to sites for courses where we're not the instructor.
My colleagues from other institutions would have even less access.

What is my point here? I think we are potentially wasting a lot of effort
but not having easy access to others' teaching material. If I am teaching
a third-year course, and I have to jump through a lot of hoops to find out
what approach was taken the instructor of the pre-requisite second-year course,
I'm probably not going to bother. If I am teaching an "Astronomy 101" course,
I am more likely to develop my own material, or rely heavily on publisher-provided
material (free to instructors but contributes to increasing costs for students)
if I can't find appropriate material available elsewhere.
