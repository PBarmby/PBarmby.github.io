Haven't commented much on the [new job]() here, but something related has been on my mind lately: how to measure/recognize the quality of teaching at the graduate level. Note: this is not official University policy or anything, it's just me thinking-by-writing. It's also only applicable to science, since that's what I'm familiar with, and here I'm just thinking about classroom teaching, not mentoring or advising or any of the other things important for graduate student training. This also only applies to places (Canada and the US) where graduate students take courses!

Maybe good graduate teaching is just good teaching, period. But graduate teaching does have some differences from other kinds, and that's what I want to get at here.

* Graduate classes are usually small.

* Graduate classes are often advanced.

* Graduate classes often aim to train "scholars".

* Graduate students have been in school for longer than most other kinds of students.

I went to a pretty well-known university for graduate school, and the quality of graduate teaching was, with a few exceptions, not terribly high. One professor's introduction to an important sub-field of astronomy consisted mostly of recounting how he once drove one of its originators to the airport. Others made (what I now realize as) classic mistakes of trying to pack in more material than humanly possible to transmit or retain, or giving assignment questions which later turned out to be unsolvable.
